Ransomware encrypts personal and other files on a computer and demands a ransom in order to recover them.<br>
In addition to file encryption, there are other types that lock the use of the PC.<br>
Some types, such as Petya, lock by rewriting the master boot record (MBR).<br>
Some types, such as NotPetya, are not restored after a ransom is paid. (Ransomware that does not undo a PC, such as NotPetya, is considered a wiper.)<br>
Some ransomware, such as WannaCry and Petya, spread their infection through the Internet and other means. In other words, if a virtual machine is connected to the Internet, it may infect the actual machine.<br>
