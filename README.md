## Warning
Running these malware is at your own risk.

We strongly recommend using virtual machines for all but jokes that do not destroy your PC. (If you have a PC that is infected with malware and can be rendered unbootable, that is still fine.)

Even a virtual machine can spread infection to the host (actual machine) if the virtual machine is connected to the Internet or USB. If you are unsure, we recommend disconnecting the virtual machine from the Internet.
